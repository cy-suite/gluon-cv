GluonVision: a Deep Learning Toolkit for Computer Vision
========================================================

GluonVision provides implementations of the sate-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning
models in computer vision. It is designed for engineers, researchers, and
students to fast prototype products and research ideas based on these
models. This toolkit offers four main features:

1. Training scripts to reproduce SOTA results reported in [research papers](link
    to the paper to code list)

2. A large number of [pre-trained models](link to model zoo)

3. Carefully designed [APIs](link to API doc) that greatly reduce the
   implementation complexity

4. [Community supports](link to how to contact us)


This toolkit assume users has basic knowledges about deep learning and computer
vision. Otherwise, please refer to xxx and yyy.

.. note::

   This project is still at an early stage. We are continuously adding more
   models and making it easier to use. Any contribution (link to how to
   contribute) is warmly welcome.


Installation
------------------

GluonVision relies on the recent version of MXNet. The easiest way to install
MXNet is through pip(lin). The following command installs a nightly build CPU
version of MXNet.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --pre mxnet

.. note::

   Most training scripts are recommended to run on GPUs. If you have a GPU
   machine, please refer to xxx to install a GPU version MXNet, or refer to xxx
   to launch a GPU instance on AWS. It's also common to run model inference on
   CPUs, refer xx to install a CPU accelerated MXNet.

Then clone the GluonVision project and install it locally

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-vision
   cd gluon-vision && python setup.py install --user

A Quick Example
----------------

(get a pretrained SSD model and then run forward)
