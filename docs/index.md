# GluonVision: a Deep Learning Toolkit for Computer Vision

GluonVision is a computer vision toolkit contains implementations of the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models. It is designed for engineers,
researchers, and students to fast prototype products and research ideas based
on these models. This toolkit offers four main features:

1. Training scripts to reproduce SOTA results reported in [research papers](link to the
paper to code list)
2. A large number of [pre-trained models](link to model zoo)
3. Carefully designed [APIs](link to API doc) that greatly reduce the
implementation complexity
4. [Community supports](link to how to contact us)

But also note that this project is still at an early stage. We are continuously
adding more models and making it easier to use. Any contribution (link to how to
contribute) is warmly welcome.

## Quick Installation

GluonVision relies on the recent version of MXNet. The easiest way to install
MXNet is through pip(lin). The following command installs a nightly build CPU
version of MXNet.

```bash
pip install --pre mxnet
```

Then clone the GluonVision project and install it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-vision
cd gluon-vision && python setup.py install --user
```

## A Quick Example:

(get a pretrained SSD model and then run forward)


```eval_rst
